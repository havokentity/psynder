# Psynder — Autonomous Build Status (live log)

Read `docs/AUTONOMOUS_MISSION.md` for the operating loop. This file is the
running ledger: update it every wake-up. Newest entries on top.

## Current branch
`integration/wave-hybrid-material-shadows` (push to origin every cycle).

## Done (recent → older)
- Editor render-settings panel (mode/sun/ambient/shadow/RT quality) + scene-level RenderSettings serialized to .psyscene.
- Raster path consumes scene lights + sun (root-cause fix: lights now actually shade in raster; goldens unchanged via opt-in gate).
- Material albedo plumbed into raster fragment shader (colors show); mat_color/mat_tex console + Inspector material editor.
- Add/Remove components in editor (no-code) over main-thread IPC, with undo.
- Physics: gen-safe handles, instance-owned World (ADR-010), rotated inertia, collider-scale fix, parenting writeback + graph-sync, zero-garbage hot paths, joint solver (kernel), angular API, vehicle + helicopter play, char controller.
- Editor: gizmo modes (Tab/G/R/Y), play mode, RT viewport toggle + lightmap bake, BSP + terrain level loaders, two independent code-review backlogs fully closed.

## In flight (this wave)
- (set by the loop)

## Next milestones (see MISSION roadmap)
M-HYB hybrid shadows → M-COMBAT → M-AI → M-PSYGRAPH → M-NET → demo games (Duke/Quake, Delta Force, NFS) → editor migration.

## Open risks / deferred
- Phase B hybrid compositing (raster+traced shadows) — biggest renderer item.
- Anti-tunneling (plane primitive + speculative contacts) — #63.
- Joints-in-play wiring on the promoted scene components; vehicle-on-terrain raycast; wheel visuals.
- Web Vite major upgrade (2 dev-only advisories).
- Pre-existing `-Wunused-function: active_arcade_rt_mode` warning (harmless).
